Problem Statement
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of
revenue is essential for long-term success and driver
happiness. 
Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise
revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need.
Our research aims to determine whether payment
methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the
relationship between payment type and fare amount.


Research Question
Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type? 
Can we nudge customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers, without negatively impacting customer experience?


Data Overview
For this analysis, we utilized the comprehensive dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records, used data cleaning and feature engineering procedures to concentrate solely on the relevant columns
essential for our investigation

Methodology
Descriptive Analysis: Performed statistical analysis to summarize key aspects of the data, focusing on fare amounts and payment types.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducted a T-test to evaluate the relationship between payment type and fare amount, testing the hypothesis that different payment methods influence fare
amounts
Regression Analysis: Implemented linear regression to explore the relationship between trip duration calculated from pickup and dropoff times) and fare amount

Journey Insights
- Customers paying with cards tend to have a slightly higher average trip distance and fare amount 
compared to those paying with cash.
- Indicates that customers prefers to pay more with cards when they have high fare amount and
long trip distance.

Preference of Payment Types
-  Astrong preference among customers for using card payments over cash, potentially due to convenience, security, or incentives offered for card transactions

Passenger Count Analysis
- Among card payments, rides with a single passenger (passenger_count = 1) comprise the largest proportion, constituting 40.08% of all card transactions.
- Similarly, cash payments are predominantly associated with single-passenger rides, making up 20.04% of all cash transactions.
- There is a noticeable decrease in the percentage of transactions as the passenger count increases, suggesting that larger groups are less likely to use taxis or may opt for alternative payment methods.
- These insights emphasize the importance of considering both payment method and passenger count when analyzing transaction data, as they provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences

Hypothesis Testing
- Null hypothesis: There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash. 
- Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash
- With a T-statistic of 165.5 and a P-value of less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is indeed a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods

Recommendations
- Encourage customers to pay with credit cards to capitalize on the potential for generating more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
- Implement strategies such as offering incentives or discounts for credit card transactions to incentivize customers to choose this payment method.
- Provide seamless and secure credit card payment options to enhance customer convenience and encourage adoption of this preferred payment method
